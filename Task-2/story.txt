Once upon a time in Gravity Tech Society,
there was a group of passionate developers
who loved exploring open source projects.

One day, they decided to create a wing called FOSS.
Its main goal was to empower students with
knowledge about open-source development and hands-on projects.

Together, they organized workshops on Linux & Git
and guided juniors in learning new tech stacks.

In the end, they believed that open source
could make the tech society stronger and more connected.
