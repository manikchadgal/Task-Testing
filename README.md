# FOSS Wing Selection Tasks

## Welcome to the selection tasks for the FOSS Wing of our technical society, Gravity.
These tasks are designed to test your debugging skills, **Git knowledge**, and **creativity**. Please read carefully and follow the instructions.

---

## General Instructions

1.  **Repository Setup**: Make a **private repository** on GitHub/GitLab, and immediately add these IDs as **collaborators** to grant access:
    * `darkknight0125`
    * `manikchadgal`
    * `Snehalgupta-07`

2.  **Initial Commit**: Commit all the initial files and instructions into your repository, and name that commit as `"Initial commit"`.

3.  **Commit Frequency**: Make commits regularly with **meaningful commit messages**.

4.  **Answer Files**: Where required, add answers/outputs in a **new file**.

5.  **Academic Integrity**: **Plagiarism will be heavily penalized.** All code and written work must be your own.

## Tasks and Scoring

### 1. Debug the Code (15 Points)

We will provide you some small buggy code snippets.

* Fix the codes so it runs correctly.
* Add the **correct output** in a new file named `task1_output.txt`.
* Commit the fixed code along with output file.

---

### 2. Git Merge Conflict (20 Points)

We will provide a file `story.txt` with some blanks.

**Your task:**
1.  Create a new branch for this task.
2.  Fill in the blanks with a sensible continuation of the story.
3.  Merge the new branch into your current working branch.
4.  Resolve any merge conflicts properly, ensuring both contributions are maintained.

---

### 3. Find First Commit Hash (10 Points)

Use `git log` to find the hash of the very first commit in this repository.

* Write the **full 40-character commit hash** in a new file named `first_commit.txt`.
* Commit this file.

---

### 4. Commit Removal (25 Points)

1.  Create a **new branch** named `history-cleanup`.
2.  Make a commit adding something.
3.  Make **3 more commits** on top of it.

**Now:**
* Remove the **first commit** while keeping the later changes intact.
* **Bonus (20 extra points)**: Ensure the original commit is completely removed from all branch history.
* Add screenshots of earlier commit history and cleaned up commit history for bonus points and explain the approach used.

---

## Additional Task (Creative Points, out of maximum 10)

Create a **personal** `README.md` in your branch (separate from this main `README`) with the following sections:

1.  A short **introduction** about yourself.
2.  Your **hobbies**.
3.  Tech **stacks** you’ve explored till now.
4.  Your **strengths**.

**Bonus points**: Add an appropriate meme at the end.

---

## Submission

1.  Ensure all tasks are committed to your working branch (e.g., `main` or a feature branch).
2.  **Push** your branch to your remote private repository.
3.  Verify that the collaborators (`darkknight0125`, `manikchadgal`, `Snehalgupta-07`) have access to view and pull your repository.

**Total Available Points: 90 (Tasks) + 10 (Additional Task) = 100 Points.**

## That’s it! Good luck, and happy hacking!
